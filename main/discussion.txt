round up the board values to 3 decimals

Discussion on Population
1. There will be 10 kernels as seed population
2. How do we generate the kernel? -> using random_kernel generator
3. How do we mutate? -> Adding random values from 0 to 1 in anywhere in the kernel  grid.
4. How are we calculating the fitness function --> Total number of alive cell in a board[threshold > 0.5]
