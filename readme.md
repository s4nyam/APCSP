### Cellular Automata

Cellular Automata (CA) is a mathematical model that is used to simulate the behavior of systems composed of a large number of simple, identical units called "cells." Each cell is assigned a state, which can be represented as a binary value (0 or 1), a color, or a number. The state of each cell evolves over time based on a set of rules that determine the new state of a cell based on the current state of itself and its neighboring cells. The rules are applied to all cells simultaneously, and the process is repeated in a time-stepping manner, resulting in the evolution of the entire system.

Cellular automata have been used in a variety of fields, including computer science, physics, mathematics, and biology, to study complex systems and emergent phenomena. Some well-known examples of cellular automata include John Horton Conway's "Game of Life," a simulation of cellular evolution in two-dimensional space, and Wolfram's "Class 1" and "Class 4" automata, which display complex, seemingly random behavior.



### Lenia
"Lenia and Expanded Universe" by Chan, Bert Wang-Chak (2020) is a research paper that presents Lenia, an artificial life platform that simulates ecosystems of digital creatures. Lenia's ecosystem consists of simple, artificial organisms that can move, consume, grow, and reproduce. The paper explains how Lenia's system is designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for the creation of a diverse range of organisms with varying abilities and behaviors. The authors also discuss the idea of an "expanded universe" for Lenia, in which multiple Lenia systems can be linked together to form a larger, interconnected ecosystem. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential applications and implications of Lenia as a tool for studying artificial life and evolution.
